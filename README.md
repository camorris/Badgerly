### Purpose

This app was designed for those who have earned a collection of online badges/skills/certs for completing  online tutorials from websites like:
codeacademy.com
lynda.com
coursera.com
degreed.com
typing.com
udemy.com

Badgerly allows visitors of the site to log in to create account a account. As a user you can create and organize your badges in a way that will display your new skillset. 

### Technology Used

For this project I used Ruby on rails to create the source code for this app. Plus I used bootstrap and css to style different aspects of  Badgery. My terminal was used to create the rails app, create models, create controllers and run the rails server to test my code. Heroku was used to deploy my website which can only be done if you are using postgres

### Unsolved
 For the project I would like to add a social aspect to the app that allows new developers to interact with employers and senior developers. In addition I would like to be able to link accounts from learning websites onto Badgerly.
